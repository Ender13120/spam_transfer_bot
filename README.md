To run this Node.js Express service from your terminal, you can follow these steps:

Install Node.js on your computer if you haven't already. You can download the installer from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/


Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where app.js is saved.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install express ethers
This command installs the express and ethers packages that the application requires.

Start the server by running the following command:
Copy code
node app.js
This command starts the Node.js server and runs the app.js file, which contains the code for the Express service. You should see a message in the terminal saying "Server started on port 3000".

Access the service by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000. You won't see any content on this page because the service only sends transactions to the specified wallet address, it doesn't return any HTML content.
The service will continue to send transactions every second until you stop the server by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
